Hi! I am TY from City University of Hong Kong. This is my final year project. It is a web-based solution of a logistic system.
This project is fully built using Javascript.

And you can start the server by using two separate console.
For frontend:

```
cd frontend && npm start
```

For backend:

```
cd backend && npm start
```

## Project Structure

This project is separated into two parts - Frontend and Backend. They use different dependencies, and therefore they need to be installed separately.

### Frontend

The frontend is built under React framework. It also makes use of different components provided by the community like React Router and React QR Code Reader.

### Backend

The backend is built under Express framework. The API connect between the frontend and backend is built using GraphQL and MongoDB.
